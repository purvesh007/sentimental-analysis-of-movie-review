# sentimental-analysis-of-movie-review

This is my class project, Classification based task project of movie review given by users whether they are positive or negative.
I have used Polarity movie review data set.
Initial step in this project is pre-processing i.e. cleaning of data, removing noise then after most important step is of feature selection and then generating final term document matrix which will be standard input for many Machine Learning algorithm.

I have runed many Machine algorithm on my model like naive Bayes, SVM, Randon Forest, K-nearest for getting output and to check Accuracy of my model.

All pre-processing and feature selction code is in main file
